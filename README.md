### Mockup

[Star Wars Catalog Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/dTlnXYIYHgOL7Ikp65ga5Y/Star-Wars-Catalog?node-id=0%3A1)

This figma is just a base for you to get some inspiration. You are more than welcome to enhance it in your application, or come up with a different design, as long as the layout and structure is smilar.

**Design Requirements**

- There should be a hero-header that contains a nice image from Starwars and the name of the application.

- Two sections, both of which take up approximately 40-50%of the width of the page.

- It must be responsive. How the layout shifts around on smaller screens is up to you.

Try to make it as pretty as possible utilizing all your CSS skills.

### Beskrivning

This is a simple Vanilla SPA that request data about characters from Star Wars and displaying them in a UI that you create.

#### The Star Wars Api - [swapi](https://swapi.dev)

**Feature Requirements**

- The left section of the application should containt a list of atleast six Star Wars characters. In the bottom of this section it should be navigation that you can click on to switch between the characters. Clicking on a character in the list should also make it switch to the character selected.

- The right section should be divided in to two. One of them should contain data about the character including: height, mass, hair color, skin color, eye color, birth year, species and gender. The other part should contain data about the character's home planet including: rotation period in hours, orbital period in days, diameter, climate, gravity, terrain and populations.

- When data is being fetched the UI should display som sort of loading animation in the corresponding section. If you are switching to a different character, the section on contating the data should have a loading animation for example. Here is a good site for getting loading animations: [css-loaders](https://css-loaders.com/).
